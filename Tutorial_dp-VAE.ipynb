    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "   This tutorial shows how to generate a new (fake) dataset using Variational Autoencoder with a differential privacy (dp-VAE). Variational Autoencoder is a self-supervised technique that includes two neural networks: an encoder and a decoder. First, an encoder from the input samples x learns two parameters, i.e. z_mu and z_log_sigma of ***a latent space***. Then, we randomly sample similar points z from the latent space as follows: \n",
    "   \n",
    "   z = z_mu + exp(z_log_sigma) * eps, \n",
    "   \n",
    "   where eps is a random normal tensor with mean = 0 and std = epsilon_std defined by a user. The user-defined standard deviation instead of unit variance is implemented to decrease an impact of outliers when scaling the input data. Finally, a decoder network maps these latent space points back to the original input data. A model is trained using a differential private Stochastic Gradient Descent (dp-SGD) as optimizer and two loss functions: ***a reconstruction loss*** describing the errors between the decoded samples and the original inputs, and ***the  Kullback-Liebler divergence*** between the learned latent distribution and the prior distribution, acting as a regularization term. \n",
    "\n",
    "   The advantages of dp-VAE compared to dp-GAN (for more details see Frigerio L., Santana de Oliveira A., Gomez L. & Duverger P. (2019) Differentially private GANs for time series, continuous and discrete Open Data) are that the algorithm can handle any type of data, i.e. numerical or discrete at the same time, and it performs much faster even with large datasets (with a lot of multiclass features or high number of features in general). Moreover, it is always possible to generate new data even if the trained model did not converge or has very low accuracy (after a few epochs). Although such generated data will have low utility, they visually look very similar to the original one, contrasting with dp-GAN, which can suffer from mode collapse after very few epochs. While it is rather challenging to generate new data with a low privacy budget for large datasets using dp-GAN, dp-VAE can perform this task quite easily keeping a reasonable level of data privacy although by decreasing data utility. \n",
    "   \n",
    "  The drawback of VAE is that the algorithm assumes that the input data are normally distributed. This is often not the case. For datasets with many differently distributed numerical attributes it is challenging to normalize all attributes using the same scaling method. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   The generation of new data can be performed in 4 following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    " - A. Input data formatting;\n",
    " - B. Model training;\n",
    " - C. New data generation;\n",
    " - D. Data quality evaluation.\n",

    "## A. Input Data Formatting\n",
    "The input data has to be scaled and reshaped before using in the Keras Functional API. First we split the input data into two datasets by data type, i.e. numerical and discrete. Numerical features are scaled using MinMaxScaler such that all feature values are in the range [0, 1]. Same as StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler suffers from the outliers in the input data and shrinks the range of the feature values. However, MinMaxScaler rescales all features to the same range while StandardScaler cannot guarantee balanced feature scales if outliers with different magnitudes are present. Discrete features are encoded to dummy variables using one hot encoder. Finally, numerical and discrete features after scaling and encoding are merged together and reshaped into an input array. The obtained array is shuffled and randomly split into train (67% of input samples) and validation data (33% of input samples).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   If the input data contains NA values they will be automatically fill in by the algorithm. A question mark is used \"?\" to fill NA values in discrete features. NA values in numerical features are filled in using 'bfill' mode (i.e. using next valid observation). Because of this step, the original data should not contain \"?\" values and if so, they must be replaced with any other character.\n",
    "   \n",

    "### 2. Original vs. Generated data: a distribution of numerical attributes\n",
    "Secondly, we can compare the distribution of numerical attributes in the original and generated datasets. The figure shows us that overall generated data preserve the attributes' distributions although we can notice that the attributes' range is shrinked compared to the original one. This is due to the model was trained in the differential private mode and some outliers were removed from the model to preserve privacy. Another reason is the MinMaxScaler that is used to scale the original data for model training. Moreover, it is challenging to normalize all attributes using the same scaling method and therefore, the VAE assumption of normally distributed input data might be violated. This negative impact can be partially reduced by the parameter ***epsilon_std*** during the model training. The higher this value, the broader the attributes' range that is covered by the model. Finally, underfitted dp-VAE model can also cause the low representation of attributes' range in the generated data."

    "### 4. Original vs. Generated data: a classifier to predict a target attribute\n",
    "The last step can be applied only for a labeled input data. We can build a ***train classifier*** for a target attribute based on the original train dataset and use it to predict the labels for the generated data. The accuracy of this classification is called **'similarity'** as it describes how similar the generated data to the original one that were used to train dp-VAE model. Using the same ***train classifier*** we can predict the labels for the original test data. The calculated accuracy corresponds to a common validation accuracy that is used to evaluate a classifier. Similarly, we can train another ***fake classifier*** for a target attribute based on the generated dataset and use it to predict the labels for the original test data. As far as the fake classifier is trained on the generated data that were not used to train the model, the obtained accuracy, so-called **'diversity'**, shows how diverse are new data that the model generates. The proposed evaluation scores were inspired by a paper of Shmelkov K., Schmid C. & Alahari K. (2018) How good is my GAN?\n",

Overall, the more outliers are in the original data, the lower diversity value will be due to privacy mode. Furthermore, the validation accuracy is also average (0.87) meaning that the original data itself might not include all necessary attributes to predict the target attribute.
