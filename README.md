# Differentially Private Generative Models

## Description:
This repository explains how generative models can be used in combination with differential privacy to synthetize feature-rich realistic categorical datasets in a privacy preserving manner. It brings two jupyter notebooks for dp-GANs (differentially-private Generative Adversarial Networks) and dp-VAE (Variational Autoencoder) to generate new data in a differetnial private mode. The code allows to quickly generate new dataset (incl. numerical features) in private or public mode. dp_SGD and dp_Adam optimizers from tensowflow/ privacy library (https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy) are used these models. 

## Requirements
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)
- [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow)
- Pandas, keras, and more see the notebooks import sections
- [H2O AutoML](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html)
- Check further dependencies in the Jupyter notebooks Tutorial_dp-GAN.ipynb and Tutorial_dp-VAE.ipynb

1. Clone Tensorflow privacy into this project repository :
```
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/privacy

cd privacy
pip install -e .
```


2. Open the notebooks in Jupyter and run them
